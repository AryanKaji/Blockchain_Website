      <p class="lead">
        Hello! I'm a passionate learner and explorer of Web3 technologies,
        including Blockchain, Smart Contracts, Decentralized Applications
        (DApps), and more. Iâ€™m fascinated by how blockchain offers
        decentralization, security, and transparencyâ€”solving real-world problems
        in innovative ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is a step in my journey to understand and visualize how
        blockchain works behind the scenes. By building this platform, Iâ€™ve
        gained insights into concepts like cryptographic hashing, block
        structure, linking via previous hashes, and transaction management.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always excited to learn more, collaborate with others, and create
        meaningful projects that make a difference. Whether itâ€™s Web3, smart
        contracts on Ethereum, or contributing to open-source projects, I'm
        committed to continuously growing as a developer.
