      Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that enables secure and
      transparent data recording and transfer without the need for a central
      authority. It is essentially a decentralized ledger composed of blocks,
      where each block contains data, a timestamp, a nonce, a cryptographic hash
      of its own content, and the hash of the previous block. This chaining
      mechanism ensures immutability, meaning once data is recorded, it cannot
      be altered without affecting all subsequent blocks â€” a nearly impossible
      task due to the cryptographic security involved.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      The first block in any blockchain is known as the Genesis Block. Unlike
      other blocks, the Genesis Block has no previous hash value and is
      hardcoded into the blockchain structure. Each new block that is added to
      the chain must reference the hash of the previous block, ensuring the
      continuity and integrity of the chain.

    <p class="text-justify">
      Blockchain is widely known as the underlying technology behind
      cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but its application extends
      far beyond digital currencies. It is now being utilized in fields such as
      finance, supply chain, healthcare, voting systems, and more due to its
      transparency, security, and trustless nature. The ability to maintain a
      shared and immutable ledger makes it ideal for industries requiring
      auditability and data consistency.

      In this application, you can visualize how a blockchain works in
      real-time. You can view the existing blockchain, navigate through
      individual blocks to see their data, and even add new blocks by entering
      transaction data. Each block's hash will be computed based on its content,
      and any tampering will disrupt the chain, clearly demonstrating the
      security model that makes blockchain robust.
    </p>

      Explore and interact with this blockchain simulator to better understand
      how each block is connected and how data integrity is maintained across
      the entire network.
